# TTS Web App and Script: Text-to-Speech for English and Hindi

This repository contains a Python-based text-to-speech (TTS) tool with a standalone script (`tts_script.py`) and a Flask web app (`app.py`). It supports English and Hindi, text input or file uploads (.txt/.pdf), variable speed control, and offline TTS to bypass API limits. Developed using Python 3.11 on Windows, with Git for version control.

## Features

- Bilingual support: English ('en') and Hindi ('hi').
- Input: Manual text or automatic extraction from .txt/.pdf files.
- Speed adjustment: Float multiplier (0.5-2.0) via pydub and FFmpeg.
- Offline TTS: pyttsx3 for local processing.
- Output: MP3 files for download/playback.
- Web interface: Form-based with file upload and selections.
- Script: Command-line for quick use.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (as used in development).
- Windows 10/11 (tested; adjust for other OS).
- Git for cloning/version control.
- FFmpeg for audio manipulation.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tts-project.git
cd tts-project
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv tts_env
tts_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```
pip install gtts flask playsound pyttsx3 pydub PyPDF2
 
```

### 4. Install FFmpeg
Use winget (recommended for Windows):
```
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
```
Or Chocolatey: `choco install ffmpeg`. Add to PATH and verify with `ffmpeg -version`.

### 5. Voice Setup for Hindi
Install Hindi pack: Settings > Time & Language > Language > Add Hindi > Include Speech.
Test voices:
```python
# test_voices.py
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
for i, voice in enumerate(voices):
    print(f"Index {i}: {voice.name} (Languages: {voice.languages})")
```
Update code with Hindi voice index.

If unavailable, install eSpeak NG via Chocolatey (`choco install espeak`) and use `'espeak'` driver with 'hindi' voice.

## Usage

### Standalone Script
```
python tts_script.py
```
- Enter file path or text, language, speed.
- Plays MP3 via playsound.

### Web App
```
python app.py
```
Access http://127.0.0.1:5000. Submit form to download MP3.

## Configuration

- Edit voice indices in code based on test script.
- Adjust speed range in HTML form.
- For online TTS: Install gTTS and swap pyttsx3 block.

## Troubleshooting

- FFmpeg errors: Set paths explicitly in code.
- No Hindi voice: Use eSpeak NG or cloud APIs (e.g., Google Cloud TTS via pip install).
- Install issues: Upgrade pip, clear cache, recreate venv.
- Partial language pack: Run DISM/SFC scans.

## Limitations

- pyttsx3 voice quality varies; eSpeak is robotic but reliable.
- PDF extraction best for text-based files.
- Internet needed for some alternatives.
